# Password Generator

This Password Generator project is a web-based application that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project offers several features to customize the generated passwords based on user preferences.

## Features

1. **Password Length Slider:** Users can select the desired length of the password by using a slider control. The slider allows users to choose a password length between 1 and 20 characters.

2. **Uppercase, Lowercase, Symbols, and Numbers:** Users can customize their passwords by selecting or deselecting the checkboxes provided for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. This allows users to include or exclude specific character types in their generated passwords.

3. **Password Strength Indicator:** The project provides a visual indication of the password strength based on the selected criteria. The strength indicator uses different colors (e.g., red and green) to represent weak, and strong passwords, respectively. This helps users assess the security level of their chosen password.
